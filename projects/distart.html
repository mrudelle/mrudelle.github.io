			24 hours, this is the time we were allowed to design and build a highly scalable platform for image processing tools. This is an idea we had during the 2016 <mark>Microsoft Imagine Hackaton at EPFL</mark> and we won as the <mark>best project</mark> of the event! The platform is executing heavy image processing code on GPU (the currently
			<a href="http://www.boredpanda.com/computer-deep-learning-algorithm-painting-masters/">famous</a> deep learning
			<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576">Neural Style</a> in this case) that were running on <mark>Amazon Web Services</mark> (GPU VMs were not available on Azure at that time). The tool we built is three-fold:
			<lu>
				<li>Providing an API for uploading images, keeping jobs metadata and keeping a queue of operations.</li>
				<li>Executing the image processing code on multiple worker machines and environment, all synchronising with the API's scalable tools to distribute the list of jobs.</li>
				<li>Providing users with a nice interface to upload and receive images: for this we chose to implement a
					<a href="https://telegram.org/blog/bot-revolution">Telegram Bot</a> to be able to interact directly from a messaging app.</li>
			</lu>
			<br>
			Each part has been implemented using Node.js that helps quickly experimenting concepts of web services.
			<br>
			The API is running under multiple scalable APP API instances. They run a RESTfull API by greedily storing job metadatas in a Storage Account Table, job images in Storage Account Blob storage to finally put the job at the end of a Storage Account Queue. These 3 entites are highly scalable and helps every actors of the system to interact seamlessly.
			<br><br>
			The telegram bot is the only non-scalable bit. For the sake of the demo it was running on a <mark>RaspberryPI</mark> at home, connected to internet under a DynDNS. The idea to build a telegram bot was to demonstrate the wide range of applications unlocked by building a RESTFull API.
			<br><br>
			The DEMO had to be shut down as GPU machines are costly when running round the clock. However you can check

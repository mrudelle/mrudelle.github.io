			A laboratory at the EPFL (LCAV) is doing researches related to artwork relighting and I was missioned to build a gallery to showcase their work, along with a user-friendly interface for their WebGl app. <br>
			I worked more particularly on building the whole gallery, a module to see images in their life-size, and a new interface for the WebGL code. This latter includes a guided tour feature, flying over the painting like a video, showing most of the relighting features. Plus a new system to move around in 3 Dimensions, in a way similar to how you can consult Google Maps.
